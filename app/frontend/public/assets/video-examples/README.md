## Prompts for Reference

### Example 1 - Camera Movement

"A soft, round animated character wakes up with a curious expression to find their bed is a giant golden corn kernel. The camera pulls back, revealing that the room is a giant, echoing corn silo where kernels are piled into towering walls."

### Example 2 - Cinematic Lighting

"Sunny lighting, edge lighting, low-contrast, medium close-up shot, left-heavy composition, clean single shot, warm colors, soft lighting, side lighting, day time. A young girl sits in a field of tall grass with two fluffy donkeys standing behind her."

### Example 3 - Motion & Action

"A group of diverse, energetic hip-hop dancers performing street dance on a vast stage, illuminated by vibrant neon lights. Dynamic, high-energy, professional dance photography."

### Example 4 - Visual Style

"3D cartoon style, a surreal dream where everything is made of corn. Main characters ride a corn train through giant corncobs and kernels bathed in warm, golden light."

### Example 5 - Visual Effects

"Time-lapse, dusk, sunset, rim light. An anthropomorphic metal robot walks down a busy city street with glass-walled buildings bathed in sunset afterglow."
