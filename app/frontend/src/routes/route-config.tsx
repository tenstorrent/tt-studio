 * Route Configuration
 * ------------------
 * This file contains the configuration for all application routes.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Import this file: import { getRoutes } from './route-config';
 * 2. Get routes: const routes = getRoutes();
 *
 * Adding Routes:
 * {
 *   path: "/example",
 *   element: <ExampleComponent />,
 *   condition: true // optional, route will only be included if condition is true
 * }
 *
 * Notes:
 * - All routes will automatically be wrapped with MainLayout
 * - Use the 'condition' property for feature flags or environment-specific routes
