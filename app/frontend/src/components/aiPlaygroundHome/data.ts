 * AI Playground Home - Model Configuration
 * --------------------------------------
 * Configuration for AI models displayed in the Playground home page grid.
 * Each entry renders as an interactive ModelCard with hover effects and navigation.
 *
 * Display Context:
 * - Rendered in a responsive grid on the AI Playground homepage
 * - Cards maintain consistent sizing and spacing
 * - Hover effects reveal additional model information
 * - Clicking navigates to the model's specific playground interface
 *
 * Model Entry Structure:
 * {
 *   id: string           - Unique identifier (e.g., "llama", "stable-diffusion")
 *   title: string        - Model name displayed on card (e.g., "Llama 3.1 70b")
 *   image: string        - Model preview image path
 *   path: string         - Route to model's playground (e.g., "/chat-ui")
 *   filter: string       - Brand color overlay for visual consistency
 *   TTDevice: string     - Tenstorrent hardware badge (e.g., "loudbox")
 *   poweredByText: string - Hardware info shown on hover
 * }
 *
 * Visual Guidelines:
 * - Images: Use 16:10 or 4:3 aspect ratio for grid consistency
 * - Colors: Filter colors should align with AI Playground theme
 * - Typography: Title appears in bottom left with device badge in bottom right
 * - Hover: Cards scale slightly and show poweredByText overlay
 *
 * Navigation:
 * - Each card links to its corresponding playground interface
 * - Use absolute paths starting with '/' for routing
 * - Paths should match your playground route configuration
 *
 * Example Card Interaction:
 * 1. User sees grid of model cards on homepage
 * 2. Hovering reveals "Powered by TT-Device" message
 * 3. Clicking navigates to model-specific interface
 *
 * @see ModelCard.tsx component for card implementation
 * @see DeployedHome.tsx Playground home page for grid layout
