TT-Studio now supports a search agent that can be integrated with your deployed LLM model. 
To use the search agent before starting TT-Studio or deploying a model , follow these steps to enable the search agent:

1. Create and add your [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/) to the environment file located at `tt-studio/app/env`.
