# run_command function: templates a command with optional logging and error handling
# Arguments:
#   $1 - Description of the action being performed (used for logging purposes).
#   $2 - The actual command to be executed.
#
# Behavior:
#   - The function evaluates the provided command ($2) using `eval`.
#   - If the command executes successfully (exit code 0), it logs a success message with a checkmark emoji.
#   - If the command fails (non-zero exit code), it logs a failure message with a cross emoji and exits the script with an error.
#
# Example Usage:
#   run_command "Updating package list" "apt-get update"
#   run_command "Cloning repository" "git clone https://github.com/repo.git /target-dir"
