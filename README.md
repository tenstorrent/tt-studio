> To use TT-Studio’s deployment features, you need access to a Tenstorrent AI accelerator.<br>
> Alternatively, you can connect just the frontend to a remote API endpoint if you do not have direct hardware access.


**TL;DR:** TT-Studio is an easy-to-use web interface for running AI models on Tenstorrent hardware. It handles all the technical setup automatically and gives you a simple GUI to deploy models, chat with models, and more.

---

TT-Studio combines [TT Inference Server's](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-inference-server) core packaging setup, containerization, and deployment automation with [TT-Metal's](https://github.com/tenstorrent-metal/tt-metal) model execution framework specifically optimized for Tenstorrent hardware and provides an intuitive GUI for model management and interaction.

## Overview

TT-Studio is a comprehensive environment for deploying and interacting with Tenstorrent models. It consists of:

- **Frontend Interface**: A modern React-based UI for model interaction
- **Backend API**: Django-based service for model management and deployment
- **TT Inference Server**: FastAPI server for handling model inference requests
- **Docker Containers**: For isolation and easy deployment
- **Automatic Hardware Detection**: Seamless integration with Tenstorrent devices
- **Automated Setup**: Complete environment configuration and model setup automation

### Using TT-Studio as a Model Interface

TT-Studio provides a unified frontend interface for interacting with various AI models including:

- Chat-based Language Models (LLMs)
- Computer Vision (YOLO)
- Speech Recognition (Whisper)
- Image Generation (Stable Diffusion)

For detailed instructions on setting up and using these models, see our [Model Interface Guide](docs/model-interface.md).

> ⚠️ **Note**: The `startup.sh` script is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use `python run.py` for all setup and management operations.

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest setup experience, run this single command that will clone the repository with all submodules and start TT-Studio:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-studio.git && cd tt-studio && python3 run.py
```

This command will:

- Clone the TT-Studio repository
- Initialize and download all required submodules (including TT Inference Server)
- Automatically configure the environment
- Start all services

### For General Users

To set up TT-Studio step by step:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-studio.git
   cd tt-studio
   ```

   > **Note**: You don't need to worry about `--recurse-submodules` - the setup script will automatically handle submodule initialization for you.

2. **Run the Setup Script**:

   Run the `run.py` script:

   ```bash
   # On Linux
   python run.py

   # On macOS
   python3 run.py
   ```

   The script will:

   - Automatically initialize and configure all required submodules (including TT Inference Server)
   - Guide you through all configuration options and set up everything automatically
   - Prompt you to provide:
     - JWT_SECRET for authentication
     - HF_TOKEN (Hugging Face token) for accessing models
     - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY for backend security
     - TAVILY_API_KEY for search functionality (optional)
     - Other optional configuration options

   > **Smart Submodule Handling**: The setup script automatically detects, initializes, and configures all required submodules, ensuring they're on the correct branches. No manual submodule management needed!

   #### See the [Complete `run.py` Guide](#documentation) for more information on command-line arguments available within the setup script.

3. **Access the Application**:

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   The FastAPI server runs on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001).

4. **Cleanup**:

   - To stop and remove Docker services, run:

     ```bash
     # On Linux
     python run.py --cleanup

     # On macOS
     python3 run.py --cleanup
     ```

5. **Running on a Remote Machine**:

   To forward traffic between your local machine and a remote server, enabling you to access the frontend application in your local browser, follow these steps:

   Use the following SSH command to port forward both the frontend and backend ports:

   ```bash
   # Port forward frontend (3000) and FastAPI (8001) to allow local access from the remote server
   ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 -L 8001:localhost:8001 <username>@<remote_server>
   ```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Tenstorrent hardware is now automatically detected and enabled. The script will automatically mount `/dev/tenstorrent` when present, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with setup, submodules, or other problems, please refer to our comprehensive [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Running in Development Mode

Developers can run the app with live code reloading for easier development.

> **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the repository cloned:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-studio.git
> cd tt-studio
> ```
>
> > **Note**: You don't need to worry about `--recurse-submodules` - the setup script will automatically handle submodule initialization for you, just like in the standard setup process.

1. **Start the Application in Dev Mode**:

   Run the `run.py` script with the dev flag:

   ```bash
   # On Linux
   python run.py --dev

   # On macOS
   python3 run.py --dev
   ```

   In development mode, the frontend and backend code will be mounted inside the container. Any changes in code will be reflected inside the container automatically.

2. **Hot Reload & Debugging**:

   #### Frontend

   - Local files in `./app/frontend` are mounted within the container for development.
   - Code changes trigger an automatic rebuild and redeployment of the frontend.

   #### Backend

   - Local files in `./app/backend` are mounted within the container for development.
   - Code changes trigger an automatic rebuild and redeployment of the backend.

3. **Stopping the Services**:

   To shut down the application and remove running containers:

   ```bash
   # On Linux
   python run.py --cleanup

   # On macOS
   python3 run.py --cleanup
   ```

4. **Model Deployment**:

   - Models are automatically set up and deployed through the TT-Studio interface.
   - No manual model configuration is required - the FastAPI server handles all model setup automatically.
